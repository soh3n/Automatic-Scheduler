I'm selling my Honda Prelude if anyone is interested, it's a 1988 si fully
loaded (red) 5 speed with a clifford alarm system bikini bra and floormats as
extras.  I'm asking 10,500.00 or best offer.  It's in excellent condition with
45k.  The only reason I'm selling it is because I'm moving to Oregon in two
weeks and I won't be needing it anymore.  If you can help find a home for my
car I would appreciate it. Call x491 Thanks,
Steph
