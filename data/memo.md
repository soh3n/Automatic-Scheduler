Hi Team,

Just a quick note regarding our briefing session on 11th SEP morning—we’ll be starting at 9:30 AM. I know it’s a bit earlier than originally planned, so I appreciate everyone adjusting on short notice.

It’ll be a virtual meeting as usual; I’ll share the platform details shortly. Please make sure you’re ready to join, as we have some important points to go over.

Thanks for your flexibility, and see you at 9:30!

Best,
Mia O'Connor
