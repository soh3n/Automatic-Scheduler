Hi Everyone,

I hope you're all doing well as we approach finals. I wanted to let you know that the time for our CS 6320 final exam has been set for Friday, November 15, 2024, and will start promptly at 2:00 PM. We will meet in-person at room ECSS 2.103 for the exam.

Please make sure to arrive a little early to settle down and have your student ID ready for verification. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the exam or the location, feel free to reach out to me ahead of time.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there and good luck with your preparations!

Best regards,
Tatiana
