Hi everyone,

I hope you're having a great week! I’m excited to invite you to a coffee catch-up this Saturday, November 16, 2024, from 9:00 AM to 10:45 AM. We’ll be meeting in person at Starbucks in the Student Union.

This gathering is all about unwinding and enjoying some good conversation over coffee, so come by when you can! There’s no need to RSVP—just bring your smiles and let’s enjoy a relaxed morning together.

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Warm regards,  
Hugo Dupont
