Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you well! I’m excited to share that I’ll be organizing a casual exploration of Northern Park Fields this coming weekend. We’ll meet at North Park Gate 1 at a time that works best for everyone—I suggest Saturday morning, but I’m open to other suggestions as well.

This will be a great opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, chat, and perhaps discover more about our local natural surroundings. It's all informal, so feel free to bring a friend!

There’s no need to RSVP; just show up with your adventurous spirit!

Looking forward to seeing you out there.

Best,  
Kwame Boateng
