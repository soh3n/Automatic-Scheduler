Subject: Time to Unwind: Join Us for a Virtual Coffee Catch-Up!  

Hi everyone,  

I hope you’re all doing well! I’m excited to invite you to a virtual coffee catch-up on Wednesday, November 20, 2024, at 1:30 PM. We’ll be meeting online via Webex to take a break, connect, and share some good conversation.  

This will be a relaxed opportunity to unwind, so grab your favorite coffee and join me for a chat. Feel free to pop in whenever you can; there’s no need for an RSVP!  

Looking forward to sharing some virtual coffee together!  

Warm wishes,  
Nadia Ali
