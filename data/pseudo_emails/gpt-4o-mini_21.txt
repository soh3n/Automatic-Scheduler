Hi everyone,

I hope you are all doing well! I would love to catch up with you at the Northside Starbucks on Sunday, November 24, 2024, from 9:30 AM to 10:15 AM. 

It’ll be a great opportunity to unwind and share some good conversations over coffee. No need for an RSVP; just come by and join in the fun!

Looking forward to seeing you there!

Best,  
Valentina Hernández
