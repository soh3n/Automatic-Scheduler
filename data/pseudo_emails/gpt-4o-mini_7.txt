Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to remind you that the deadline for project submission is approaching quickly. Please ensure your submissions are completed by November 22, 2024, at 1:00 PM. 

Additionally, we will hold a presentation of the projects via Webex right after the submission. This is an excellent opportunity to showcase your work and receive valuable feedback.

Let me know if you have any questions or need clarification on the submission process. I appreciate your hard work and commitment.

Best regards,
