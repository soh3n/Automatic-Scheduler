Subject: Let's Fix Our Homework Submission Date!  

Hi everyone,

I hope youâ€™re all doing well! I wanted to touch base regarding our homework submission date. I believe it might be beneficial for us to discuss adjusting it during our in-person meeting on November 26, 2024, at 8:30 AM.

This will give us a chance to ensure everyone is on the same page and has the time needed to complete their assignments thoroughly. 

Please come prepared with any suggestions or thoughts you might have. Looking forward to a productive discussion!

Best,  
Klara Novak
