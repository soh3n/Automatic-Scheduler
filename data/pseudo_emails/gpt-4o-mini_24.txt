Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well! I’d like to invite you to join me for a relaxing coffee break this Wednesday, November 13, 2024, from 2:45 PM to 3:15 PM at the café. It’ll be a nice opportunity to unwind, catch up, and enjoy some good conversation.

No need to reply—just stop by if you can! I’m looking forward to a lovely afternoon together.

Best,  
Kwame Boateng
