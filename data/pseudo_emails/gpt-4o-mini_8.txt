Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well! I’d like to invite you to a cozy book discussion at our favorite café, Northpark Bluebottle, on Tuesday, November 19, 2024, from 3:45 PM to 5:15 PM.

It’ll be a great opportunity to share thoughts on the latest book we've been reading and enjoy some nice coffee together. There’s no need to RSVP; just bring your passion for books and your favorite mug if you'd like!

Looking forward to seeing you!

Warmly,  
Putri Dewi
