Hello Everyone,

I hope you're all having a wonderful day! I’m excited to extend a warm invitation to a lunch party I’m hosting today, November 20th, from 11:15 AM to 1:00 PM. We'll be gathering in the Student Hall for some great food, good company, and enjoyable conversations.

This will be a relaxed and informal get-together, and it’s a fantastic opportunity to unwind and enjoy some time with friends and colleagues. No need to RSVP—just come as you are and bring along your cheerful spirit.

Looking forward to seeing many friendly faces there!

Best,
Thabo Mbeki
