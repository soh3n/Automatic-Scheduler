Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well! I'm excited to invite you to our upcoming monthly team brainstorming session scheduled for Thursday, November 28, 2024, from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM. We’ll be meeting in person at the Crimson Cafe.

This is a fantastic opportunity for us to come together, share ideas, and collaborate on various projects we have in the pipeline. Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to what we can achieve collectively.

Feel free to bring along any materials you’d like to discuss. I hope to see all of you there!

Best,  
Lakshmi Iyer
