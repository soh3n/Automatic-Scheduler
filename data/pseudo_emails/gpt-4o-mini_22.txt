Subject: Final Exam Study Group Meeting - Important Reminder!

Hi everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well! This is a friendly reminder about our upcoming Final Exam Study Group Meeting scheduled for Monday, November 18, 2024, at 10:30 AM. We’ll meet in our regular classroom. 

Please make every effort to attend, as we’ll be going over crucial topics that will be covered in the exam. It would also be great to share any questions or insights you may have, so we can support each other effectively.

Could you please confirm your attendance? Feel free to reach out if you have any topics you’d like us to focus on during the session.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there!

Best,  
Yasmin Jaber
