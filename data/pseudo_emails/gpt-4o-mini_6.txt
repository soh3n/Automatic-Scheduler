Hi everyone,

I hope you are all doing well! I would like to invite you to a collaborative study session at the McDermott Library, Room 101, on Monday, November 18, 2024. The session will run from 10:00 AM to 11:15 AM.

This will be a great opportunity for us to come together, share our insights, and support one another as we prepare for our upcoming assessments. Please let me know if you can attend, as I would love to know how many of you will be able to join.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best,  
Zola Dlamini
