This means\nthat in the near future, there will be a new telephone on your desk. Along\nwith your new telephone, you will also have your own personalized voice mail\nbox. The new phones operate slightly different from the current ones, however\nthey are much easier to operate.\n\nThe cutover for the new system has been scheduled for February 15,16,and 17.\nDuring these three days, there will be no incoming or outgoing calls to Atari or\nTengen. We hope that the transsision goes smoothly, and if everything goes as\nplanned you will have your new telephones on the 18th of February. There will\nbe two technicians from PacTel Meridian Systems and myself to assist you with\nany questions that you might have.\n\nThe new telephone system is distributed by Pactel Meridian Systems and is\nmanufactured by Northern Telecom. If you have any questions or concerns \nregarding this matter, I can be reached at Extention 1710.",
