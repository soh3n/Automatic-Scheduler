Subj:	Walkabout Friday -- 3:30-5:00 -- 2/7/92 -- New and improved!


     Rusty Dawe and the Atari Games Network team will be hosting
this week's Walkabout Friday. We will be having more labs (and 
more munchies!) to Walkabout through this month: Tengen and
Training Simulation  R&D. Both of these areas are on the North
end of the building  -- just follow the crowd! 
 
     The festivities will begin at 3:30 in the Alpha, Nu, Omega,
Tengen, and Simulation R&D labs. Please come by the labs, sample the
munchies, play the games, and give your feedback (positive and
negative).

                       Friday, Feb. 7, 1992
                        3:30 - 5:00 p.m.
