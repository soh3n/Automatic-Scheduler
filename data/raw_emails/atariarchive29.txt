As of April 20th 1992, All employees must first dial an   8  in order
to abtain an outside line. We are currently using 9 to dial out, but
due to Tengen's extentions starting with 9, we had to change it to 8.
You may not know but in reality Tengen's extentions start with a 9
instead of a 4. As of April 20th, whenever dialing a Tengen extention
you must also include the 9, for example :

                   Deborah Geyer's extention is  427

                   As of April 20th, will be     9427.

There will be no three digit extentions as of April 20th.
