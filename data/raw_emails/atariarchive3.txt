Subj:	New Telephone System


To :  Atari and Tengen Employees

Atari has adquired a new telephone system and voice mail as well. This means
that in the near future, there will be a new telephone on your desk. Along
with your new telephone, you will also have your own personalized voice mail
box. The new phones operate slightly different from the current ones, however
they are much easier to operate.

The cutover for the new system has been scheduled for February 15,16,and 17.
During these three days, there will be no incoming or outgoing calls to Atari or
Tengen. We hope that the transsision goes smoothly, and if everything goes as
planned you will have your new telephones on the 18th of February. There will
be two technicians from PacTel Meridian Systems and myself to assist you with
any questions that you might have.

The new telephone system is distributed by Pactel Meridian Systems and is
manufactured by Northern Telecom. If you have any questions or concerns 
regarding this matter, I can be reached at Extention 1710.
