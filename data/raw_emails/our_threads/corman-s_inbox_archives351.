Rick
I need you to work out a full budget for this class & the Houston class --
both the customer portion + the individual employee travel expenses that will hit our budget.  Once you have the cost estimate together, lets sit down=
and make sure we're okay from an overall budget perspective and then make sure that the participating staff know that we need to stick to the budget.
What did we put in the 2002 plan for the TW contract training?
