On Friday, February 28, at 2:00, in the Central Conference Room, there 
will be a meeting to discuss Alan Gray's functional design of the 
"Macintosh Universe CAD System."  This is a follow-up meeting which was
preceded by one held on Jan. 22 where we discussed the requirements.
Lois Turner has design document copies which are available upon request.
