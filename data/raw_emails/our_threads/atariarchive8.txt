Subj:	New telephone system/New area code.


The installation of the new telephone system has been delayed until 
04/17/92, due to additional preparations that need to be made before 
the system can be installed.

Effective January 27, 1992 calls dialed to the oakland/east bay area 
must include the 510 area code. Calls dialed without the 510 area code 
will not be complete, and callers will reach a recorded announcement 
with a reminder to dial  (510) before the 7 digit telephone number.
