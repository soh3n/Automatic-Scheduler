We have to do some minor power maintenance and we have to re-arrange the
placement of some of the equipment in the computer room this saturday
(1/25/92). If I'm lucky (rarely), it will follow this schedule:

There will be no modem access the whole day.

Approximately between the hours of 9am to 11am you may find the following:

The Unix systems agc and dms will be down which means no name and
	font servers for you X terminal users!
The Terminal servers will be down which means no printer or terminal access to
	the vaxes for anyone.
The ethernet will behave goofy or won't work at all.
KIM and BERT will be down and the others will probably crash just to
annoy me.

All of this will be due to the fact that none of this equipment will be
plugged in.

Then, sometime between the hours of 11am and 1pm you may find that no
telephones anywhere in either 675 or 735 work. This will be due to the fact
that the Rolm system will be unplugged.
