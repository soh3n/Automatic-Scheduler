Subj:	WANTED:  GAMEBOY


I have a friend who is looking to buy a GameBoy, used.  If you know someone
who isn't using theirs anymore (maybe because they now have a Lynx or Game Gear)
and wants to sell it, please call me at x1714 or x1794, or reply to this
address.  It's got to have Tetris, but I believe all GameBoys were sold with it.

Thanks,
Natalie
