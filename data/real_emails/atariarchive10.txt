On Tuesday, February 18, I will be at Wells Gardner to participate in an
industry review and critique of their new video displays (Model U1000 Series).
I am looking for feedback from the game designers (and any other interested
parties) on the following:

1. What problems with the existing displays would you like to see corrected.

2. What new features would you like to see included in these displays.

3. What are the video specifications for new hardware currently under
   developement and for hardware desings to be developed in the near future.

Now is your chance to have your opinions and and wishes communicated directly
back to Wells Gardner. They are still in the design stage for these displays,
and this will give us an opportunity have our problems and opinons addressed.
I need to have your feedback by Friday, February 14.
