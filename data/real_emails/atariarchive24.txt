    As many of you know, Ed Rotberg is leaving us.  His going away lunch will
be this Friday, under the trees of a park nearby.  Watch this space for the
exact location.  Management has requested that we leave no earlier than 11:30,
and that we be back at work by 2:00.  That should be long enough for a quick
softball game, some frisbee, or Smashball.

Thanks,
Natalie
