What problems with the existing displays would you like to see corrected.\n\n2. What new features would you like to see included in these displays.\n\n3. What are the video specifications for new hardware currently under\n   developement and for hardware desings to be developed in the near future.\n\nNow is your chance to have your opinions and and wishes communicated directly\nback to Wells Gardner. They are still in the design stage for these displays,\nand this will give us an opportunity have our problems and opinons addressed.\nI need to have your feedback by Friday, February 14.\n\n\n\t\tRick",
